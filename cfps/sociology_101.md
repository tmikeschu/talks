# Marx on Rails - What Sociology Can Tell Us About Software

## abstract

Sociology seeks to answer one of three questions: (1) How does society stay the
same? (2) How does society change? (3) How does society develop shared meaning?

These questions have been asked and answered in a variety of contexts, such as
race, socioeconomic class, and gender. How can we use these findings to help us
understand the community and industry of software development? Could Karl Marx
help us understand the volatile nature of JavaScript frameworks? Could Emile
Durkheim help us understand the stability of and loyalty to Rails? Could Max
Weber help us understand the resurgence of functional programming?

Be it your workplace, local meetup, or open-source group, this talk will provide
you with insight about building, maintaining, and changing community with
intention.

## pitch (Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.)

Thinking about society at a theoretical level involves a
lot of abstraction and pattern recognition, which I think is a great way to
appeal to software developers to think about topics beyond programming.

As a speaker, I'm very energetic and compassionate. With a natural and genuine
love for learning, I often get feedback that my talks are very engaging. I have
experience teaching adults and I've given talks at various meetups around Denver
and Detroit, as well as RailsConf and self.conference. I also take a lot of
initiative at work to present lunch and learns.

## bio (Your bio should be short, no longer than 500 characters. It's related to why you're speaking about this topic.)

Mike Schutte is always uncomfortable describing himself in third person. He's a
solutions engineer at Clinc and lives in Detroit. In 2016, he pivoted his career
aspirations from sociology to software development. He has a deep passion for
learning, teaching, and writing elegant code for software that improves everyday
life. He loves spreading the gospel of sociology to help people think critically
about "the soup they swim in".
