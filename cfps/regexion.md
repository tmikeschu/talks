# Dealing with /Regexion/

## abstract

We’ve all been there. You want to to parse a string with a bit o’ regex. You
have to account for things like dashes and three-digit-numbers and
words-that-start-with-capital-letters. So you cobble together some sketchy stack
overflow results, toss em between those infamous forward slashes, and cross your
fingers. Maybe 10% of the time you get what you want, the other 90% leaves you
with an empty string or nil. Either way, your heart feels fragile, and you just
need a hug.

This, my friends, is regexion. Like rejection, it hurts. Don't feel bad though,
it happens to everyone (especially Rubyists). We love our expressive syntax, so
it’s hard to not see regex as inscrutable black magic. This talk provides
context for why regex is worth the effort and dives into advanced techniques
like capture groups and lookaheads. You will walk away with the tools and
mindset to face regexion with courage and optimism.

## pitch (Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.)

I love helping others approach their work with joy and confidence. Having a
clear and calm mind make a big difference when solving difficult problems. Based
on hearsay and my own experience, regex is one of those things that people kind
of avoid really understanding. They figure out a solution and move on, only to
go through a similar sense of frustrating guesswork the next time regex presents
itself. I think a lot of people would benefit from this talk and have renewed
motivation and confidence to learn and use regex for the right types of
problems.

As a speaker, I'm very energetic and compassionate. With a natural and genuine
love for learning, I often get feedback that my talks are very engaging. I have
experience teaching adults and I've given talks at various meetups around Denver
and Detroit, as well as RailsConf and self.conference. I also take a lot of
initiative at work to present lunch and learns.

## bio (Your bio should be short, no longer than 500 characters. It's related to why you're speaking about this topic.)

Mike Schutte is always uncomfortable describing himself in third person. He's a
solutions engineer at Clinc and lives in Detroit. In 2016, he pivoted his career
aspirations from sociology to software development. He has a deep passion for
learning, teaching, and writing elegant code for software that improves everyday
life. He has a hard-won (and somewhat reluctant) love for regex and all it can
do, and is excited to tell you about it!
